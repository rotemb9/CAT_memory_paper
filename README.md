1. Directory "experiment_codes" includes the codes for running the experiment.
* Pilot Experiment- "bmem_snacks"
* Experiment 1- "bmem_snacks2"
* Experiment 2- "bmem_short"

The experimental codes were run on 21.5 inch iMAC computer with the following softwares:
* Matlab version 2014b (Mathworks, Inc. Natick, MA, USA)
* The Psychtoolbox (www.psychtoolbox.org)
* Python-based Pygame package (the BDM task; python version 2.7)

2. Directory "analysis_codes" includes the codes for analyzing the data from all experiments.
The analysis was performed with R version 3.6.3
To run the codes you need to insert the correct path of the data files at beginning of the code.

3. Directory "data" includes the data from all experiments as Rdata files.
